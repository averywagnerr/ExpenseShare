## :money_with_wings: Description

ExpenseShare is an expense organizer that allows you and a group of other people to keep on top of your expenses and easily check past expenses along with calculating new expenses. Unlike RocketMoney, our product allows you to scan receipts to speed up the process of tracking and splitting expenses.

### :star: Features

- **Group Account Creation**: Enable users to create group accounts to manage shared expenses, allowing for CRUD operations for groups, members, and expenses. Users can add, edit, or remove group members and expenses as needed.

- **Automated Expense Calculation**: Implement automated calculation of who owes what to whom based on entered expenses. The app will automatically calculate each member's share of the expense and update the balances accordingly.

- **Integration with Payment APIs**: Integrate with payment APIs such as Venmo or PayPal to enable users to settle debts directly within the app. Users can make payments to other group members to settle their debts quickly and conveniently.

- **Historical Expense Tracking**: Provide historical tracking of all group expenses and settlements, allowing users to view past transactions and payments. This feature helps users keep track of their spending and ensures transparency within the group.

- **Notification System**: Implement a notification system to alert users about upcoming payments or unsettled debts. Users will receive notifications reminding them of pending payments or debts that need to be settled, helping them stay organized and on top of their finances.

- **Payment APIs Integration**: Integrate with payment APIs like Venmo or PayPal for seamless transactions within the app. Users can securely make payments to settle their debts or reimburse group expenses directly from the app.

- **OCR (Optical Character Recognition) Integration**: Potentially use OCR APIs to scan and split receipts, making it easier for users to track and split expenses accurately. This feature eliminates the need for manual entry of expenses and simplifies the expense-sharing process.
